The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [January 4, Monday, 2021].

## Log

### R1D1 
I prepared my empty website.
Only basic access analysis function is created using PHP. I haven't yet decided exactly what direction the website will take.

### R1D2
1. I wanted to create chat app.
2. I learned that UDP is used in network games.
3. I found out that http://Socket.io seems to be useful for making chat app.
4. I needed to know Node.js and NGINX.
5. I did a tutorial and created a chat app.

### R1D3
I wanted to create a development environment for NGINX + Node.js + MongoDB, so I read the MongoDB Get Started documentation.
I've learned that you need to select systemd as a boot option to install on MX Linux. I was able to install it successfully and proceed with the tutorial.
